# Spin Orbit Coupled Attractive Hubbard Interactions
Project done along with Rabsan Ghalib Ahmed on understanding the effects of both Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit coupling in superconducting phase transitions. This was done as part of a course on Quantum Phases of Matter and Phase Transitions taken by Prof. Sanjeev Kumar.
